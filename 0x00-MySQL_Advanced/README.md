## Creating Tables with Constraints

Constraints are rules applied to columns or tables to enforce data integrity. Here's how you can create tables with constraints:

### Primary Key Constraint
A primary key ensures each record in a table is uniquely identifiable.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Foreign Key Constraint
A foreign key establishes a link between two tables to maintain referential integrity.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```

### Unique Constraint
A unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    username VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## Optimizing Queries with Indexes

Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations by providing quick access paths to the data.

### Creating an Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_username ON users(username);
```

## Stored Procedures and Functions

Stored procedures and functions are reusable code blocks stored in the database.

### Creating a Stored Procedure
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllUsers()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM users;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

### Creating a Function
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION CalculateTotalAmount(price INT, quantity INT)
RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    RETURN price * quantity;
END;
```

## Views in MySQL

Views are virtual tables based on the result of an SQL statement.

### Creating a View
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
```

## Triggers in MySQL

Triggers are special stored programs executed automatically in response to events.

### Creating a Trigger
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER after_insert_order
AFTER INSERT ON orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO order_logs(order_id, action) VALUES(NEW.order_id, 'inserted');
END;
```

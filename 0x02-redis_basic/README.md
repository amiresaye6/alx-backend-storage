## Introduction to Redis

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams.

## Basic Operations

### Installing Redis
To install Redis, you can follow the official [installation guide](https://redis.io/download).

### Connecting to Redis
You can connect to a Redis instance using a client library in your preferred programming language. Popular client libraries include `redis-py` for Python, `redis` for Node.js, and `StackExchange.Redis` for .NET.

### Setting and Getting Values
"""python
import redis

# Connect to Redis
r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Set a value
r.set('key', 'value')

# Get a value
value = r.get('key')
print(value)
"""

### Expiring Keys
You can set an expiration time (in seconds) for a key in Redis.

"""python
# Set a value with expiration (in seconds)
r.setex('key', 3600, 'value')
"""

### Deleting Keys
You can delete keys in Redis.

"""python
# Delete a key
r.delete('key')
"""

## Using Redis as a Simple Cache

Redis is commonly used as a cache due to its fast read and write operations.

### Cache Set and Get Operations
"""python
# Set a value in the cache
r.set('username', 'john', ex=3600)  # Expire in 1 hour

# Get a value from the cache
username = r.get('username')
print(username)
"""

### Cache Miss Handling
When a key is not found in the cache, you can handle cache misses by fetching the data from the primary data store and then setting it in the cache.

"""python
# Get user profile from cache
profile = r.get('user_profile')

if profile is None:
    # Fetch profile from the primary data store
    profile = fetch_profile_from_database()

    # Set profile in the cache
    r.set('user_profile', profile, ex=3600)  # Expire in 1 hour
else:
    print("Profile found in cache")
"""

Redis provides a simple and efficient caching solution for applications.
